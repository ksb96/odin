    <h1>CHILLI PORK</h1>

        Juicy pork slices with hot chillies in every bite, chilli pork can double as a side dish as well as a standalone
        snack.

        <h3>Description</h3>
        We like our chilli pork juicy, where stir-fried pork slices are accompanied with hot green chillies in every
        bite. Weâ€™re using the pork belly as it is fatty, but you could also use the leaner shoulder. This simple recipe
        leads to twice-cooked chilli pork. The meat is first boiled until tender and then stir-fried. This recipe is
        also reminiscent of the chilli pork on the menus of several Chinese restaurants in Calcutta.
