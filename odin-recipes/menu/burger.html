        <h3>Description</h3>
        Here's Chef John's take on a classic cheese-stuffed burger that's famous in the Midwest. "This isn't just any
        old cheeseburger. Depending on whom you talk to, it's either called a 'Juicy Lucy,' or a 'Jucy Lucy,'" says Chef
        John. "That's because two restaurants in Minneapolis claim to have invented it, and they spell it differently.
        Make sure you thoroughly and thoughtfully press the edges of the two patties together to seal in the cheese
        stuffing, which keeps the meat juicier. Spread your favorite burger sauce over the bun."
